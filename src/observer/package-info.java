/**
 [Behavior Design Pattern]
 In Java the Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency
 between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified
 and updated automatically. The object which is being watched is called the subject.
 The objects which are watching the state changes are called observers or listeners.
